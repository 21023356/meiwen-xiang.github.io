title: Blue Whale in Hintze Hall
---

Browsing the NHM website providing the VR tour of the building, the huge skeleton of a bluewhale hanging in the hall caught my eye. The section "The Ocean" of the website relating to this exhibits literaly gave thorough introductions to the whale and also a human activity, whaling, which had threatened the species in histroy. In my view, "the era of whaling" in this section is very impressive by showing old pictures of people risking their lives to hunt the largest mammals on earth. As it is reported, more than 340,000 blue whales were killed in the first half of 20th century. We really should take responsibilities for protecting the whale.
